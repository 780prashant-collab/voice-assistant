1. Project Title

Jarvis 2.0 – Personal AI Voice Assistant

2. Project Description

Jarvis 2.0 is an advanced AI-powered voice assistant designed to automate daily tasks using speech recognition, natural language processing, and system control features. It interacts with users through voice commands, performs web searches, opens applications, answers questions, automates workflows, and provides real-time responses.
This project demonstrates a combination of Machine Learning (TensorFlow), Python automation, and conversational AI.
3. Project Objectives

Build a fully functional AI Voice Assistant using Python.

Implement Speech Recognition & Text-to-Speech capabilities.

Integrate a trained Deep Learning model to understand user intents.

Automate tasks like browsing, searching, opening applications, answering queries, etc.

Create an interactive and intelligent voice-based user experience.

Develop a modular, scalable structure for future AI integrations.

4. Tools Used and Their Usage

1 – Project Folder Structure

This shows the main project directory including the ML model, intents file, voice engine code, and automation modules.

2 – Training the Intent Model

The TensorFlow/Keras model is trained using a custom dataset stored in intents.json. The model learns patterns and predicts user intents.

3 – Speech Recognition in Action

The system listens to the user’s voice, converts it into text, and processes it using the ML model.

4 – Task Automation

Jarvis opens browsers, automates tasks, manages system resources, and responds instantly based on user instructions.

6. Project Conclusion & Learnings

Conclusion:
Jarvis 2.0 successfully demonstrates how AI, automation, and voice interfaces can be combined into a powerful assistant. It showcases how machine learning models can understand user intent and perform meaningful tasks in real time.
